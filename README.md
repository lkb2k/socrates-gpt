Part of my ongoing experiments with LLM interactions.

Stochastic Socrates is a single-page web application that facilitates an interview-like interaction 
between the user and the OpenAI Chat Completions API.  This app requires an OpenAI API key, the key is stored
locally in your browser and not sent to the server.  

The application itself was mostly written by ChatGPT, the prompt is in the docs folder.

## Running the App Locally
```bash
    npm install
    npm run serve
```
